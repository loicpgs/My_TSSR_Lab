# My_TSSR_Lab
This repository serves as my technical lab and journal as I train to become a certified Systems and Network Technician (TSSR - France).  Here you'll find: - My virtual lab setups (VirtualBox, Ubuntu Server, Windows VM) - Bash scripts and Linux command tests - Networking experiments (IP configuration, Netplan, ping, DNS troubleshooting)
